Hi! this project is done thanks to the NPM Course at Platzi. 
In this course we create this litte project to know more about npm handling dependencies and configurations of the project. We also published this project in npmjs.com
The functionality of this little project is to generate random names when you execute it in your terminal with the command "random-msg".

```npm
npm install -g random-msg
